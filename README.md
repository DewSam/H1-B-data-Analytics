# H1-B Visa Sponsorship Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This individual project focuses on creating a narrative through **data visualization** and **color theory** using **R Studio** and **Adobe Illustrator**. The objective was to design a comprehensive poster that effectively communicates the data story regarding H1-B visa sponsorships. The project emphasizes skills in data cleaning, data exploration, aggregation, and applying design principles to organize and present data through high-quality visualizations.

## Story

Many international students pursue education in the U.S. with the goal of securing employment afterward. The **H1-B visa** is a common pathway for international students to transition from their student visas to work visas in the U.S.

### Motivation:
The project provides insights for international students navigating their career prospects in the U.S. By analyzing **H1-B visa trends** and the factors influencing sponsorship (e.g., policy changes), this project aims to help international students better understand job market demand, skills in demand, and potential opportunities.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of **900,734 rows** and **12 columns**, each representing an employer petition to hire H1-B nonimmigrant workers for specific fiscal years. Key variables include:
- Number of initial approved/denied petitions
- Employer details such as city, state, and industry

The data was retrieved from the [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub/h-1b-employer-data-hub-files) and combined into a comprehensive dataset.

## Tools & Methodology

### **Tools Used:**
- **R, R Studio**: For data cleaning, exploration, and visualization
- **Adobe Illustrator**: To design the final poster by combining the visualizations

### **Key R Packages:**
- **Ggplot2**: For creating advanced visualizations
- **Dplyr & Tidyr**: For data manipulation and cleaning
- **GridExtra, Treemapfy**: To arrange multiple visualizations
- **RcolorBrewer**: For applying color theory in visualizations
- **Maps**: For geographic visualizations

In this project, I used **R programming** to clean and explore the data, applying functions from the **Tidyverse** package and R techniques to generate the necessary visualizations. **Adobe Illustrator** was utilized to finalize the poster design by integrating R-generated visuals with design elements for a cohesive presentation.

## Learning Outcomes

Reflecting on this project, my progress aligns with the core learning outcomes of the program:

### 1. **Data Collection, Storage, and Access**
- I utilized **web scraping techniques** to gather data from various sources. After retrieving and cleaning the dataset, I demonstrated proficiency in handling large datasets and using appropriate technologies for data collection, storage, and preparation for analysis.

### 2. **Create Actionable Insight Using Data Science Life Cycle**
- By leveraging **R** and the **data science life cycle**, I explored the immigration data pertaining to H1-B visas. The project provides insights that are valuable to international students and businesses, highlighting trends in H1-B sponsorship.

### 3. **Apply Visualization and Models**
- I used **ggplot2** and **basic R functions** to create visualizations that provided insights into H1-B visa sponsorship trends over the years. These visualizations offer actionable insights on the factors influencing visa approvals and rejections.

### 4. **Use Programming Languages for Data Insights**
- **R** was the primary programming language used for this project, enabling in-depth analysis and meaningful insights from the data through effective visualization techniques.

### 5. **Communicate Insights Through Visualization**
- The final deliverable was a **poster presentation**, showcased at the **iSchool poster day**, which effectively communicated the findings through data visualization. The presentation was aimed at a broad audience, demonstrating my ability to convey complex data insights to a non-technical audience.
